    # openjdk is not a real dependency, but, r-base has a post-link and post-
    # activation hook that calls R CMD javareconf, which pokes around for any
    # installations of java. On modern versions of macOS, a binary called
    # `java` is included, but it only launches a GUI installation alert,
    # indicating to the user that there is no "true" installation of java
    # present. By including openjdk on osx hosts, this pop-up is prevented at
    # installation and activation time of the environment.
